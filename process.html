            <p><strong>Stage 1 – Submission of Research Proposal Prior to Defense</strong> <br><br>
                Before the proposal defense, students are required to submit their 
                thesis/dissertation proposals for checking. They shall be given  an initial clearance  which will serve as a basis that the proposal 
                has been approved by the Center as to the following criteria:
                <ol>
                    <li>Correctness of the statistical design;</li>
                    <li>Validity and reliability of the instrument;</li>
                    <li>Appropriateness of the statistical tool related to the objectives of study 
                        and the type of research; and</li>
                    <li>Adequacy of the sample size.</li>
                </ol>   
            </p> <hr>

            <p><strong>Stage 2 – Submission of Research Proposal After the Defense</strong> <br>
                After the proposal defense, students are required to submit their 
                thesis/dissertation proposals for rechecking. They shall be given a 
                clearance which will serve as a basis that the Center has given them
                permission to proceed on gathering their data. This includes validation of 
                research instrument, pilot testing, and gathering data to target samples. (Request for Clearance of Conduct Research) <br><br>
                <i>Stage 1 and 2 will be covered by Service 1(Initial Consultation) of 
                    the Center.</i> </p> <hr>

            <p><strong>Stage 3 – Submission of Data</strong> All gathered data are required to be submitted to the Center. Data 
                encoding, checking, validation, and cleaning will be carried out in this 
                stage. In addition, all instruments used during the data collection process should be properly submitted by the researcher to the Center for 
                verification. <br><br> <i>Service 2 (Data Encoding/Cleaning) will be covered on this stage.</i></p> <hr>

             <p><strong>Stage 4 – Data Analysis and Interpretation</strong> Once the data are collected and passed in stage two (2), it will be 
                properly and appropriately be analyzed by the statisticians of the Center.
                Statistician will be responsible for checking the conclusions, suggesting 
                the best ways to describe and display the data, and basic statistical 
                interpretation of the findings. All outputs/results will be formatted using 
                the standard format and will be interpreted to the client. <br><br>
            <i>Either Service 3 (Analysis/Interpretation) or Service 4 (Output 
                Checking) will be covered on this stage. In the case that the 
                student has availed service 3, service 4 will no longer be 
                necessary. On other hand, all statistical analysis that was not done 
                by the Center are required to avail service 4 (Output Checking) of 
                the Center.</i></p>   <hr>

             <p><strong>Stage 5 – Clearance from the Center</strong>The clearance from the Center includes the initial and final clearance.
                The intial clearance shall be issued to the researcher if the proposal was 
                already approved for defense. The final clearance shall be issued if the 
                research methods applied and basic interpretations are already checked 
                and approved for final defense. The charge for a consultation will depend 
                on the service availed by the student. For detailed breakdown of fees, see 
                Chapter V, section III of this manual. <br> <br>
                <i>Schedule of payment</i> – Fees will be collected once the student availed the 
                service of the Center for Statistics and Computing Sciences. Additional 
                payment will be charged to the student depending on the consultation 
                services. Additional charge should be settled before the release of the results/outputs. All payment shall be properly settled at the Cashiers 
                Office in their respective campus. <br> </p>   <hr>

                <p>All students conducting thesis/dissertation for the <strong><u>graduate and 
                    undergraduate level</u></strong> are required to secure a final clearance from the 
                    center.</p>
